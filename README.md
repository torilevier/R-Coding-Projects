## Independent Project Final Code
The Framing Effect is a bias that people have when it comes to perceiving information presented in different ways. This effect was first presented by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979 which was based on participantâ€™s decisions to be risk averse or risk seeking in varying scenarios. Since then, the literature on the Framing Effect has expanded greatly to measure phenomena outside of risk. In our study, we wanted to investigate The Attribute Framing Effect which is two equivalent scenarios framed positively or negatively (Peng et al., 2013). We also primed participants with positive or negative faces to prime their affect (Skandrani-Marzouki & Marzouki, 2012). We were curious to know if these conditions had an effect on altruism and/or cognitive effort, so we measured the levels of altruism and cognitive effort through willingness to help and time spent per question. We hypothesized that positively primed participants with positive framing conditions would show higher levels of altruism, and that they would also show higher levels of cognitive effort. We tested ninety-one participants and found that participants given positively framed questions showed higher levels of altruism and willingness to help others. We also found that participants who had been negatively primed with faces and given negatively framed questions showed the highest levels of cognitive effort compared to all other conditions which did not align with our initial hypothesis.

## Conformity Model
The purpose of this model is to explore the emergence of fads as a function of varying levels of conformity and anticonformity.
Agents will choose between three options (grow a beard, grow a mustache, or be clean-shaven) based on one of two conformity strategies. Some agents will be "conformists": these agents will adopt facial hair styles in proportion to how popular they are in their social group. Other agents will be "hipsters": these agents will adopt facial hair styles in proportion to how unpopular they are in their social group.

## Disease Transmission
This is a simple model of infectious disease transmission. Agents will move around a 2-dimensional surface and potentially spread an infectious disease to those nearby.
The model will manipulate the number of agents who move vs. stay in place (i.e. social distance) and observe the effect of social distancing on disease spread.

## Life Dinner Principle Model
The purpose of this code is to observe the "life-dinner principle": in coevolutionary arms races, prey animals have the advantage in that they are fighting for their lives whereas predators are just fighting for dinner.
Agents representing rabbits and foxes will have random encounters with one another. Whether the rabbit escapes--and whether the fox eats--will depend on their relative speed.
Rabbits will reproduce only if they survive; foxes will reproduce only if they get enough to eat.

## Schelling Segregation
The purpose of this model is to determine whether segregation can be explained by individual motivations to avoid being a local minority. Agents will move around a two-dimensional space depending on whether they are a racial minority within their local neighborhood.
